Hello! I'm Edward, I have an MSc Artificial Intelligence from the University of Southampton, UK.

I'm based in London, United Kingdom, and work as a Consultant in DevOps and Software Engineering. I'm experienced in developing tools to allow clients to deliver high quality products to their customers as fast as possible. As a DevOps Engineer, I have delivered automated CICD solutions to reduce delivery time, immutable infrastructure on AWS as well as Google Cloud Platform. As a Software Engineer I delivered a range of solutions at different points in their life cycle. I have also delivered training to clients to ensure a smooth handover of solutions.

I'm fuelled by my passion to improve existing workflows, by listening to the users and translating them into achievable goals. I'm looking out to better myself not only in my field as well as in leadership skills. I strive to help others in understanding their problem in order for them to find the best solutions.

I work on a contract basis and I'm currently open for new opportunities.
